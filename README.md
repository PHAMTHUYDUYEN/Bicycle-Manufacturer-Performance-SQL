# [SQL] E-Commerce Website Performance Analysis
## **I. INTRODUCTION**
In this project, **_business performance of an e-commerce website_** was analyzed using **_SQL_** in **_Google BigQuery_**, with some advanced SQL techniques like **_window function_** and **_aggregate function_**. The analysis covered critical business aspects such as **_website traffic, customer behavior patterns, revenue generation, sales performance,_** and **_conversion optimization_**. The **_insights_** derived from this work provided **_support to the Sales and Marketing teams_**, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions.
## **II. DATASET**
- The e-commerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset under ID: `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions`.
  
- Table Schema: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en
  
## **III. KEY AREAS TO ANALYZE**
  - **_Website Traffic & User Behavior:_** Analyze traffic patterns (`total visits, pageviews`), user engagement (`bounce rate`), and how different types of users (purchasers vs. non-purchasers) behave in terms of pageviews.

  - **_Sales Performance & Revenue Analysis:_** Evaluate the `revenue generated` from different traffic sources over time (by week and month).
    
  - **_Product Performance & Conversion Optimization_**: Analyze `related products purchased by customers` (to identify product affinity and potential cross-selling opportunities) and calculate `cohort map` from product view to addtocart to purchasec (to identify conversion rates and shopping behavior).
## **IV. EXPLORE THE DATASET**
### **Query 1: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017**
```SQL
SELECT FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) month
      ,SUM(totals.visits) visits
      ,SUM(totals.pageviews) pageviews
      ,SUM(totals.transactions) transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331' 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
| month	| visits	| pageviews	| transactions| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|201701	|64694	|257708	|713|
| 201702	| 62192	| 233373	| 733| 
| 201703	| 69931	| 259522	| 993| 

:arrow_right: In March 2017, there was a notable **_improvement across all key metrics_** (visits, pageviews, and transactions) compared to January and February. This increase could indicate either **_improved conversion rates_** or **_influence of seasonal factors_** only.

### **Query 2: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017**
- Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit
```SQL
SELECT trafficSource.`source` AS source
      ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
      ,COUNT(totals.bounces) AS total_no_of_bounces
      ,ROUND(COUNT(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits)*100.0,3) AS bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| source	| total_visits	| total_no_of_bounces	| bounce_rate| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| google	| 38400	| 19798	| 51.557| 
| (direct)	| 19891	| 8606	| 43.266|

| reddit.com	| 189	| 54	| 28.571| 
| qiita.com	| 146	| 72	| 49.315| 

:arrow_right: **_Google_** generates the **_highest traffic_**, yet it also experiences a **_high bounce rate_**. Both **_YouTube and Facebook_** exhibit the **_highest bounce rates_**, whereas other sources of traffic such as direct,dfa,reddit,etc. demonstrates stronger user engagement. A **_targeted marketing strategy_** should be implemented to **_reduce bounce rates_**, particularly **_from high-bounce sources_** such as Google, YouTube, and Facebook.

### **Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017**

This trend suggests an **_increasing effectiveness in converting_** browsers into buyers, likely attributable to enhanced marketing efforts or an improved user experience.

## **V. CONCLUSION**
In conclusion, my analysis of the eCommerce dataset using SQL on Google BigQuery has uncovered valuable **_insights into total visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rates, and revenue per traffic source_**, which can inform future business decisions. The **_next step_** will involve **_visualizing_** these insights and key trends using software such as Power BI or Tableau. Overall, this project demonstrates the **_effectiveness of employing SQL and big data tools_** like Google BigQuery to **_derive meaningful insights from large datasets_**.
