# [SQL] E-Commerce Website Performance Analysis
## **I. INTRODUCTION**
In this project, SQL techniques were applied using Google BigQuery to analyze the performance data of an e-commerce website. The analysis covered critical business aspects such as website traffic, customer behavior patterns, revenue generation, sales performance, and conversion optimization. The insights derived from this work provided support to the Sales and Marketing teams, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions.
## **II. DATASET**
- The e-commerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset under ID: `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions`.
  
- Table Schema: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en
  | Field Name|	Data Type	|Description|
  | --- | :---: | --- |
  | fullVisitorId	| STRING	| The unique visitor ID.|
  | date	| STRING	| The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format.| 
  | totals	| RECORD	| This section contains aggregate values across the session.| 
  | totals.bounces	| INTEGER	| Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null.| 
  | totals.hits	| INTEGER	| Total number of hits within the session.| 
  | totals.pageviews	| INTEGER	| Total number of pageviews within the session.| 
  | totals.visits	| INTEGER	| The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session.| 
  | totals.transactions	| INTEGER	| Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session.| 
  | trafficSource.source	| STRING	| The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter.| 
  | hits	| RECORD	| This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits.| 
  | hits.eCommerceAction	| RECORD	| This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected.| 
  | hits.eCommerceAction.action_type	| STRING	| The action type. Click through of product lists = 1, Product detail views = 2, Add product(s) to cart = 3, Remove product(s) from cart = 4, Check out = 5, Completed purchase = 6, Refund of purchase = 7, Checkout options = 8, Unknown = 0. Usually this action type applies to all the products in a hit, with the following exception: when hits.product.isImpression = TRUE, the corresponding product is a product impression that is seen while the product action is taking place (i.e., a "product in list view").| 
  | hits.product	| RECORD	| This row and nested fields will be populated for each hit that contains Enhanced Ecommerce PRODUCT data.| 
  | hits.product.productQuantity	| INTEGER	| The quantity of the product purchased.| 
  | hits.product.productRevenue	| INTEGER	| The revenue of the product, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be given as 2400000).| 
  | hits.product.productSKU	| STRING	| Product SKU.| 
  | hits.product.v2ProductName	| STRING	| Product Name.| 
  | fullVisitorId	| STRING	| The unique visitor ID.|
## **III. KEY AREAS TO ANALYZE**
  - **Website Traffic & User Behavior:** Analyze traffic patterns (`total visits, pageviews`), user engagement (`bounce rate`), and how different types of users (purchasers vs. non-purchasers) behave in terms of pageviews.

  - **Sales Performance & Revenue Analysis:** Evaluate the `revenue generated` from different traffic sources over time (by week and month).
    
  - **Product Performance & Conversion Optimization**: Analyze `related products purchased by customers` (to identify product affinity and potential cross-selling opportunities) and calculate `cohort map` from product view to addtocart to purchasec (to identify conversion rates and shopping behavior).
## **IV. EXPLORE THE DATASET**
### **Query 1: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017**
```
SELECT FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) month
      ,SUM(totals.visits) visits
      ,SUM(totals.pageviews) pageviews
      ,SUM(totals.transactions) transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331' 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
| month	| visits	| pageviews	| transactions| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|201701	|64694	|257708	|713|
| 201702	| 62192	| 233373	| 733| 
| 201703	| 69931	| 259522	| 993| 

:point_right: In March 2017, there was a notable improvement across all key metrics (visits, pageviews, and transactions) compared to January and February. This increase could indicate either improved conversion rates or influence of seasonal factors only.

### **Query 2: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017**
- Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit
```
SELECT trafficSource.`source` AS source
      ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
      ,COUNT(totals.bounces) AS total_no_of_bounces
      ,ROUND(COUNT(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits)*100.0,3) AS bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| source	| total_visits	| total_no_of_bounces	| bounce_rate| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| google	| 38400	| 19798	| 51.557| 
| (direct)	| 19891	| 8606	| 43.266| 
| youtube.com	| 6351	| 4238	| 66.73| 
| analytics.google.com	| 1972	| 1064	| 53.955| 
| Partners	| 1788	| 936	| 52.349| 
| m.facebook.com	| 669	| 430	| 64.275| 
| google.com	| 368	| 183	| 49.728| 
| dfa	| 302	| 124	| 41.06| 
| sites.google.com	| 230	| 97	| 42.174| 
| facebook.com	| 191	| 102	| 53.403| 
| reddit.com	| 189	| 54	| 28.571| 
| qiita.com	| 146	| 72	| 49.315| 

:point_right: Google generates the highest traffic, yet it also experiences a high bounce rate. Both YouTube and Facebook exhibit the highest bounce rates, whereas other sources of traffic such as direct,dfa,reddit,etc. demonstrates stronger user engagement. A targeted marketing strategy should be implemented to reduce bounce rates, particularly from high-bounce sources such as Google, YouTube, and Facebook.

### **Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017**

This trend suggests an increasing effectiveness in converting browsers into buyers, likely attributable to enhanced marketing efforts or an improved user experience.

## **V. CONCLUSION**
In conclusion, my analysis of the eCommerce dataset using SQL on Google BigQuery has uncovered valuable insights into total visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rates, and revenue per traffic source, which can inform future business decisions. The next step will involve visualizing these insights and key trends using software such as Power BI or Tableau. Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of employing SQL and big data tools like Google BigQuery to derive meaningful insights from large datasets.
